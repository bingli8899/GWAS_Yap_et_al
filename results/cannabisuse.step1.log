Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
Beta:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
P:	p-Value
N:	Sample size
N_CAS:	Number of cases
N_CON:	Number of controls
