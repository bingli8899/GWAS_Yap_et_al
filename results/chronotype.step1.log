Interpreting column names as follows:
Variant_ID:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
Allele1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
Allele2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
Weight:	Sample size
Meta_ln_OR:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
Meta_P_Corrected:	p-Value

Reading sumstats from /Users/bingli/Documents/GitHub/GWAS_Yap_et_al/data/sumstats/chronotype.tsv into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 10000 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 8472 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1528 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1528 SNPs remain).
Removed 3 SNPs with N < 465218.6666666667 (1525 SNPs remain).
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was 0.024, which seems sensible.
