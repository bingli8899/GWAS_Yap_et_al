Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
ALLELE1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
ALLELE0:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
BETA:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
P_BOLT_LMM:	p-Value

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /Users/bingli/Documents/GitHub/GWAS_Yap_et_al/data/reference/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from /Users/bingli/Documents/GitHub/GWAS_Yap_et_al/data/sumstats/baldness.tsv into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
WARNING: 74 SNPs had P outside of (0,1]. The P column may be mislabeled.
Read 19123862 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 17956163 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 74 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.

Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1167625 SNPs remain).
Using N = 205327.0
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was -1.2033e-05, which seems sensible.
Removed 3 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1167622 SNPs remain).
