Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
Non_effect_Allele:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
Effect_Allele:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
Beta:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
P:	p-Value

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /Users/bingli/Documents/GitHub/GWAS_Yap_et_al/data/reference/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from /Users/bingli/Documents/GitHub/GWAS_Yap_et_al/data/sumstats/income.tsv into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 9444642 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 8804427 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 1 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
640214 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (640214 SNPs remain).
Using N = 286301.0
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was -3e-05, which seems sensible.
Removed 2 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (640212 SNPs remain).
