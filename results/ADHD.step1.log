Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
P:	p-Value
BETA:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /Users/bingli/Documents/GitHub/GWAS_Yap_et_al/data/reference/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from /Users/bingli/Documents/GitHub/GWAS_Yap_et_al/data/sumstats/ADHD.tsv into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 6774224 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 5638864 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 7 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 1034 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1134319 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1134319 SNPs remain).
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was -0.0001000050003333, which seems sensible.
Removed 1 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1134318 SNPs remain).
