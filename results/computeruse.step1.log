Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
ALLELE1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
ALLELE0:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
BETA:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
P_BOLT_LMM_INF:	p-Value

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /Users/bingli/Documents/GitHub/GWAS_Yap_et_al/data/reference/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from /Users/bingli/Documents/GitHub/GWAS_Yap_et_al/data/sumstats/computeruse.tsv into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 2619541 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 2451384 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 196 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
167961 SNPs remain.
Removed 243 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (167718 SNPs remain).
Using N = 408815.0
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was 3.278405e-05, which seems sensible.
Removed 118 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (167600 SNPs remain).
